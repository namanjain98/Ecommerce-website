									<p>A mobile phone, cell phone, cellphone, or hand phone, sometimes
									shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone 
									that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the 
									user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency 
									link establishes a connection to the switching systems of a mobile phone 
									operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).
									Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore,
									mobile telephones are called cellular telephones or cell phones, in North America.

									<p><h5>1917</h5>
										A handheld mobile radio telephone service was envisioned in
										the early stages of radio engineering. In 1917, Finnish
										inventor Eric Tigerstedt filed a patent for a "pocket-size folding
										telephone with a very thin carbon microphone".
										Early predecessors of cellular phones included analog radio 
										communications from ships and trains.
										</p>
										<p><h5>Kosher phone</h5>
											There are Orthodox Jewish religious restrictions which, by some
											interpretations, standard mobile telephones overstep.
											To deal with this problem, some rabbinical organizations have 
											recommended that phones with text-messaging capability not be used 
											by children.[14] Phones with restricted features are known as kosher
											phones and have rabbinical approval for use in Israel and elsewhere
											by observant Orthodox Jews.
